# Example 10: Social Science - Schelling Segregation Model
# Research question: How do individual preferences lead to macro-level segregation?
# Use case: Understanding social dynamics and tipping points

model: "models/Segregation.nlogo"  # Schelling's classic segregation model
ticks: 300  # Sufficient time for neighborhood stabilization

parameters:
  # Population composition
  - name: "density"
    spec:
      min: 60.0
      max: 95.0
      step: 5.0
    # Population density: [60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95]

  # Critical parameter: similarity tolerance
  - name: "%-similar-wanted"
    spec:
      min: 10.0
      max: 80.0
      step: 5.0
    # Fine-grained to detect tipping points: [10, 15, 20, ..., 80]

  # Neighborhood definition
  - name: "number-of-ethnicities"
    spec:
      values: [2, 3, 4, 5]
    # Test different group complexities

  # Spatial constraints
  - name: "neighborhood-radius"
    spec:
      values: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    # How far agents look for similar neighbors

# Multiple repetitions crucial for stochastic social processes
repetitions:
  reps: [10, 15, 20]  # High reps needed due to randomness in agent behavior
