model: "models/sample.nlogo"
ticks: 150

parameters:
  # Method 1: Range Specification (Linear Spacing)
  # Best for: Continuous variables with uniform importance across range
  # Use case: Testing effect of population size in regular increments
  - name: "population-size"
    spec:
      min: 100.0
      max: 500.0
      step: 100.0
    # Results in: [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]

  # Method 2: Fine-grained Range (Dense Sampling)
  # Best for: Identifying critical thresholds or phase transitions
  # Use case: Finding optimal learning rates or mutation probabilities
  - name: "learning-rate"
    spec:
      min: 0.01
      max: 0.10
      step: 0.01
    # Results in: [0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ..., 0.10] (10 values)

  # Method 3: Logarithmic Specification (Exponential Spacing)
  # Best for: Variables spanning multiple orders of magnitude
  # Use case: Testing different time scales, rates, or probabilities
  - name: "mutation-rate"
    spec:
      n: 6
      base: 10.0
    # Results in: [0.000001, 0.00001, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1]

  # Method 4: Custom Base Logarithmic
  # Best for: Non-decimal exponential growth (e.g., powers of 2)
  # Use case: Network sizes, memory allocations, iteration counts
  - name: "network-size"
    spec:
      n: 5
      base: 2.0
    # Results in: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]

  # Method 5: Explicit Value Lists (Categorical/Custom)
  # Best for: Specific values of interest, categorical variables
  # Use case: Testing known important values, strategy comparisons
  - name: "strategy-type"
    spec:
      values: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.618, 0.75, 1.0]
    # Results in: Exactly these 6 specific values

  # Method 6: Sparse Sampling (Large Steps)
  # Best for: Initial exploration of wide parameter spaces
  # Use case: Preliminary screening before fine-grained analysis
  - name: "environment-complexity"
    spec:
      min: 0.0
      max: 1.0
      step: 0.2
    # Results in: [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]

  # Method 7: Critical Values Focus
  # Best for: Testing around known important points
  # Use case: Sensitivity analysis around equilibrium points
  - name: "threshold-parameter"
    spec:
      values: [0.45, 0.48, 0.49, 0.5, 0.51, 0.52, 0.55]
    # Focused around critical value of 0.5

# Adaptive repetitions based on parameter combinations
repetitions:
  reps: [3, 5, 8]  # Start with 3, increase if high variance detected
